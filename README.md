# AI

install all requirements by

pip install -t "s:\user\target \AI folder" -r req.txt

it will install all requirement in this folder and will be portable

else use pip install -r req.txt to install globally

but for pyaudio u will need Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater get it with https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ else u can use pyaudio kept in this folder locally

if u have it then in cmd type pip install pyaudio to install it globally

note pyaudio is already present in it.

also print and type are two different commands
